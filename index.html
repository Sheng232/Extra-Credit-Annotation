                        The I.V.F. Protection Bill provides right to access fertility treament 
                        vitro fertilization. Under the bill, indiviuals have the right 
                        to access fertility treatments without limitation.
                        The discussion of the article is to highlight the debate over the I.V.F. 
                        Protection bill in congress. 
                        A key event that led to this bill discussion is the
                        overturn of <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18">Roe V. Wade</a> in 2022 by Supreme Court 
                        Justices appointed by President Donald Trump. The overturn of Roe V. Wade
                        triggered a wave of ban on abortion and reproductive rights.

                        <strong>The first highlight is about Senator Chuck Schumer, being the
                            majority leader of the Democratic party.</strong> To connect this to 
                            with the Legislative Branch Unit, a Majority/Minority leader in the Senate is 
                            arguably the most important role in the Senate because the Vice President's
                            role is for tie breaker. The Majority leader's role includes:
                            Legislative Agenda, Floor Management, Communicty between parties...
                            The Following image shows the hierarchy in the Senate:

                     <p>   
                        <strong>The second highlight is the context, the third highlight is the 
                        following: </strong>
                        "All but two Republicans present... voted against allowing the I.V.F. 
                        access bill to move forward, leaving 
                        Democrats nine votes short of the 60 necessary to begin debating it."
                        The reason why the article implies that Democrats needed sixty is because of the **Fillibuster**.
                        Because the Senate does not have a rule to restrict
                        debate time, it is theoretically possible for a senator
                        to keep a debate going until the bill is thrown into
                        the pigeonhole. But thanks to a rule in the Senate book in 1917,
                        the debate can end with a 2/3 majority in the Senate called the 
                        "Cloture". This was later changed to a 3/5 majority, or 60 Senator 
                        vote to enact cloture. The article says that Democrats are 9 votes short of 60
                        because it needs a super-majority in the Senate to start the 
                        debate due to the threat of a Fillibuster.

                        <strong>The seventh Highlight:</strong>
                        "Ahead of the vote, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, sought 
                        unsuccessfully to push forward an alternative bill that would make 
                        states ineligible to receive Medicaid funding if they ban access to 
                        I.V.F."
                        This highlight is to demonstrate the process on which a bill is ammended and passed
                        in the Senate. A bill such as this one, by Ted Cruz is drafted. It is then introduced
                        for Committee review. The committees/subcommittees can hold hearings and amend
                        the bill before sending it to the full Senate for debate. Then Scheduling for debate ->
                        Floor Debate -> Voting -> Signed by the President to sucessfully turn it into law

                        <strong>Summary: </strong>The article discusses the significance 
                        of GOP opposition of the I.V.F bill which provides right to access vitro
                        fertilization. The article then discusses President Trump's position on 
                        the bill, that he is hyprocritical for "supporting" I.V.F but appointing justicies
                        that overturned Roe v. Wade. Then it goes on about the reason for this Bill
                        being in consideration the first place, it is because I.V.F is in jeopardy of
                        being banned in many conservative states. For example, Alabama ruled for
                        fetal personhood, which posses a substantial threat to I.V.F treatments.
